"""boardd_shim — routes hermes_cli.kanban_db through the boardd broker when
HERMES_KANBAN_BROKER=1.

This is the REAL mechanism the runbook's flag refers to (the earlier draft
claimed a flag that did not exist — BLOCKER-1). It is wired in by a minimal
frozen patch that appends, at the END of kanban_db.py, a block that rebinds the
module's public functions to the delegates below (see
`kanban_db.broker-shim.patch.diff`). Rebinding at end-of-module (not a runtime
monkeypatch of module attributes) is what makes `from hermes_cli.kanban_db
import add_comment` callers ALSO get the broker path: the end block runs during
kanban_db's own import, before any dependent module finishes `from … import …`.

Coverage (delegated to boardd, exactly-once via op_id):
  connect / connect_closing (→ BrokerConnection) and the core op functions
  create_task, add_comment, claim_task, heartbeat_worker, set_workspace_path,
  set_branch_name. Lifecycle hooks fire CLIENT-SIDE (off the broker DB thread).

Anything NOT yet covered fails LOUDLY (NotImplementedError) instead of silently
corrupting: a raw multi-statement write_txn on a BrokerConnection, create_task
with parent links, etc. The CI gate + this loudness are what let cutover proceed
only when the necessary condition is actually met.

# The broker exists to serialize writers to the ONE live+corrupting board: fleet
# (~/.hermes/kanban/boards/fleet/kanban.db, the board `current` points at, which
# max-parallel's 14 workers write). Per-seat boards are archived legacy and the
# `default` board is dead; a raw sqlite open of EITHER cannot corrupt fleet, so
# routing them through the single writer is pure downside (couples unrelated
# boards to boardd's availability). connect()/connect_closing() therefore route
# to the broker ONLY when the requested open RESOLVES TO THE FLEET DB, and pass
# every other board straight through to the ORIGINAL local sqlite connect.
#
# Correctness rules (a drifting copy of the resolver = split-brain routing):
#   * The requested path is resolved with kanban_db's OWN resolver, exactly as
#     the real connect() does — explicit db_path used as-is, else
#     kanban_db_path(board=…) honoring HERMES_KANBAN_DB → HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD →
#     <root>/kanban/current → default. Never a hardcoded string, never a reimpl.
#   * The fleet IDENTITY is anchored on board_dir("fleet")/kanban.db (kanban_db's
#     own board_dir → boards_root → kanban_home), NOT kanban_db_path("fleet"):
#     a stray HERMES_KANBAN_DB override must never be able to REDEFINE what fleet
#     is (it may only redirect a REQUEST, which is still compared to this fixed
#     identity).
#   * Both sides are realpath'd (symlinks are live on this box) with a
#     not-yet-created leaf tolerated, so the first connect() that creates the
#     file still routes correctly.
