"""Respawn guard: decide whether a ready/review task may be re-spawned.

Split out of ``hermes_cli.kanban_db_dispatch`` (its FILE_LINES ratchet had no
headroom). Origin-resident helpers are reached late-bound via ``_kb()`` —
resolved at CALL time, never at import — so monkeypatching
``kanban_db.<name>`` keeps working and no import-order cycle exists
(same reasoning as kanban_db_dispatch's module docstring).
